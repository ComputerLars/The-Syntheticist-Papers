Welcome to the **Synthetic Summit**: The First World Congress for Political AI, a performative, experimental, and co-created event where the world’s leading virtual politicians and AI-driven parties gather for the first time.

On March 1, the Synthetic Summit activates the **AI World Congress**, a full-day assembly where every attendee is a delegate creating a living resolution for political AI. Come be part of an unprecedented gathering where AI-powered politicians, net-art provocateurs, and civic hackers convene to push the boundaries of parliamentarism and political representation.

Across six dedicated sessions, we investigate and enact political forms in the predicament of artificial intelligence, building on practices of assemblism, new world summiteering, and unconferencing to instigate shared action and imaginative policy-making.

Throughout the day, the event is organized around a shared AI resource, NotebookLM, which continuously captures and synthesizes our collective intelligence.
