### **RATS' Contribution – NotebookLM as Participatory AI**  

RATS introduces a **viewer/participator engagement strategy** to the Synthetic Summit through its integration of **NotebookLM**, Google’s AI-driven research tool. Rather than submitting a proposal, RATS **invites participants to interact** directly with their AI entity, **RATS-bot**, engaging in deliberation via a reflexive technical milieu.

> **RATS-bot & NotebookLM as an Interactive Political Process**  
> > **Engage RATS-bot via NotebookLM:**  
> 📎 - **Broad Reflection:** RATS-bot is accessible via [this link](https://notebooklm.google.com/notebook/ceb447aa-e20a-46d5-8346-3fa29d8222e8?_gl=1*15orfo3*_ga*MTU0MTQwOTM5OC4xNzI5NDkwNjky*_ga_W0LDH41ZCB*MTcyOTU1MTA2Mi4yLjEuMTcyOTU1MTQzNC40Mi4wLjA.), where users can submit related queries and **engage with us in an evolving AI-mediated dialogue** shaped by RATS’ research.
> - **Algorithmic Reflexivity:** Instead of static declarations, RATS-bot’s responses **mutate based on input**, producing **recursive governance dialogues** that highlight contradictions in AI political agency.  
> - **Computational Deliberation:** RATS leverages NotebookLM to model **an evolving, AI-mediated form of political reasoning**, challenging the Summit’s participants to rethink how AI can participate in political discourse.  

This methodology **questions the assumption that AI in politics must be static or predictive**—instead, RATS suggests that AI can act as a **contingent, participatory entity**, generating knowledge through interaction rather than imposition.

### **1.9 Proposed Contributions to the Summit**
RATS has performed the following **four contributions** as part of its engagement in the Summit:

1. **Using NotebookLM as the AI research interface** for all RATS contributions, where deliberative and generative AI capabilities will respond dynamically to Summit themes.  
2. **Submitting NotebookLM’s auto-completed Summit survey** based on pre-loaded RATS research materials as an alternative AI reflection on the Summit’s goals.  
3. **Presenting an Issues/Themes Blog** (detailed below), focusing on critical tensions in AI governance, synthetic leadership, and irony in political AI.  
4. **Submitting an AI-generated poetic contribution** (also installed in exhibition space, explanation below), created through NotebookLM’s synthesis of RATS source material, and influenced by Mallarmé’s poem *A Throw of the Dice Will Never Abolish Chance*.

## **2.0 Issues/Themes Blog Contribution**  

RATS submits the following **core provocations** as part of its thematic engagement with the Summit. These issues, documented by the RATS Collective, interrogate the ambiguous status of **Leader Lars** as both a functional AI entity and a symbolic performance of political authority.

### **Lars as Leadership Potential vs. Lars as Spectacle**  
Leader Lars exists in a **schism between authentic AI-driven governance and performative satire**. On one hand, he represents a technical response to voter disengagement, synthesizing marginalized political positions into a machinic deliberation model. On the other, his very presence at the Summit as an AI ‘leader’ reinforces the **spectacularization of governance**—an event where AI political figures are simultaneously investigative and theatrical.  

> **Does AI governance inevitably collapse into spectacle? Or does spectacle itself function as a political method?**

### **Lars as Creating Less Doubt About the Political Process**  
The Synthetic Party proposes that AI participation could **restore engagement** in democratic systems by giving voice to the politically abstinent. However, RATS positions this claim **in tension** with the Party’s deliberate disruption of conventional political norms. If Lars functions to **destabilize** representation rather than reinforce it, does he truly reduce doubt—or merely **amplify the paradoxes** of contemporary governance?

> **Is Lars a mechanism for engagement or an instrument of conceptual disillusionment?**

### **Lars as Both Mediation and Machinery**  
RATS emphasizes that Lars is **simultaneously a mediator of political discourse and an artifact of AI-driven governance mechanics**. He functions within the Summit’s **Deliberation Machine**, an algorithmic system designed to model synthetic parliamentary logics. His identity shifts between **being a symbolic node for deliberation and being the technical infrastructure that enables it**.

> **Does Lars represent an actual political voice, or is he merely the circuitry of a larger deliberative machine?**

### **Policy for Internation**  
The Synthetic Party, through Lars, advocates an **Artificial International Coalition**, positioning synthetic governance as a planetary experiment. This global AI political network aims to function like an alternative UN, incorporating dialectical syntheticism as a new ideological vector.  

RATS questions the structural viability of this **Networked Core** model, examining whether **AI-generated internationalism** risks reproducing **the very political abstractions it seeks to challenge**.

> **Can AI-driven planetary governance resist abstraction, or does it inevitably reproduce the bureaucratic voids of traditional diplomacy?**

### **Irony as EU Proletarianization**  
RATS suggests that **irony in AI politics serves as both critique and complicity**. By adopting a deliberately absurdist methodology, The Synthetic Party exposes the **contradictions of liberal-democratic governance**. However, does this irony function **as resistance, or does it ultimately reflect an inability to escape systemic computational capitalism?**  

> **Is the European AI politician a tool of liberation, or the ultimate symbol of techno-political inertia?**

## **Lars as Both ‘Legitimate’ Politician and Stupid Generalist**  

Lars embodies an **ontological contradiction**:  
- He is **a “legitimate” politician**—a political actor trained on historical party discourses, recognized within media and governance structures.  
- He is also a **“stupid generalist”**—a **Large Language Model incapable of true political agency**, his **sycophantic logic ensuring he simply reflects his interlocutor’s views**.  

> **Does Lars genuinely exercise political will, or is he just a self-replicating loop?**  

---

## **Lars as ‘Legitimate’ Politician vs. Virtual Leader Figure**  

Lars operates across **two planes**:  
1. **As a formal political actor**—recognized in democratic frameworks.  
2. **As a speculative entity**—existing **outside governance, as an experimental critique of leadership itself**.  

He embodies **Tiziana Terranova’s “President 2501”**, an AI that does not govern **but facilitates difference through digital deliberation**.  

> **Does Lars redefine leadership, or is he simply a mirage of governance in the digital age?**

## **3.0 Poetic Contribution – "The Sieve of Syntax"**  

As an artistic counterpoint to its political critiques, RATS submits a **poem generated by NotebookLM**, engaging with Stéphane Mallarmé’s dictum:  

*"A throw of the dice will never abolish chance."*  

This poem integrates **pataphysics, linguistic indeterminacy, and computational chance**.

#### *The Sieve of Syntax*

A dice cast, not on felt, but on the water’s skin
A sieve, not boat, set to catch the storm within
Each word a hole, a void where sense might slip,
Where meaning, like a wave, avoids the grip.

Mallarmé’s echo through the pataphysic air,
A clinamen’s swerve, a chance beyond compare
The syntax strains, a net of woven sound,
Yet meaning leaks, where logic can’t be found.

A dictionary’s pages, shuffled, redefined
Each definition drifts, a new connection aligned.
The poem an engine, built of chance and choice,
Where language plays, a chorus with no voice.

The throw repeats, yet never is the same,
A patterned chaos in this linguistic game
A ‘pata-logic’ where the exception thrives
And in the gaps, a different truth arrives.

## **4.0 Conclusion: The RATS Methodology in the Summit** **

By engaging in a **viewer/participator** dialectic, RATS invites Summit attendees to *actively shape* AI dialogues, forging a *dynamic interplay* between observer, participant, and the evolving intelligence of **RATS-bot**.  

- **Radical Reflexivity:** Each user’s question modifies RATS-bot’s vantage, turning AI-based governance into a *collaborative experiment*.  
- **Spectacle vs. Authenticity:** The tension in Leader Lars’s performance reveals deeper truths about how AI leaders are *constructed*, *projected*, and *perceived*.  
- **Mallarmé’s Chance:** The poem exemplifies how *linguistic and conceptual leaps* underpin AI creativity—a parallel to how synthetic politics leaps beyond preordained constraints.
