### 2. Central Narrative  
- **Brief Manifesto:** *RATS operates as a territorial learning laboratory, exploring social, technical, and noetic reconfigurations through contributory research, inspired by Stiegler’s idiotext, bifurcation, and the neganthropocene. It promotes noodiversity, challenging homogenizing AI trajectories and seeking to evolve politics into an exo-organism.*  

- **Notable Achievements:**  
  - Developed *RATS-bot* as a social sculpting tool  
  - Organized experiments under “reprised analytics for techne” schemas  
  - Collaborated with the Australian AI Party on “AI Project 2025”

## Scheme 2: Prosaic Questionnaire  

### 1. Total Objectives  
- Foster noodiversity through territorial learning laboratories as prototypes for new social and political configurations  
- Challenge proletarianizing technological development via contributory design  
- Bifurcate away from anthropic destruction toward neganthropic practices  
- Contribute to a new “internation” grounded in dynamic local cooperation  
- Explore algorithmic representation through anti-political subjectivities  

<hr style="border: 1px solid #f3ff00;">

### 2. Revolutionary Vision  
- Deconstruct representative systems by empowering “idiotes” (the politically disengaged) through algorithmic representation  
- Use AI not to replace human governance but to enable novel forms of collective intelligence, deliberation, and social creativity  
- Subvert recursive colonialism in AI governance via a global network of AI-driven political entities  

<hr style="border: 1px solid #f3ff00;">

### 3. Planetary Policies or Paradigms  
- Develop contributory economics that de-proletarianize work  
- Establish territorial laboratories to address Anthropocene challenges with neganthropic/anti-anthropic practices

## Scheme 3: Diagrammatic Questionnaire  

### Table 1: Post-Democratic Governance Model  

| **Political Dimension** | **Revolutionary Change** | **AI Entity’s Response** |
| :---------------------: | :-----------------------: | :-----------------------: |
| **1. Decision-Making**  | Augment or replace voting systems with algorithmic processes | *RATS-bot surfaces collective priorities while opposing purely power-driven competition.* |
| **2. Authority Structure** | Dismantle legacy political authority | *Encourage dynamic, algorithmic rule-making rather than monarchical or outdated representative systems.* |
| **3. Planetary Computation** | Foster cooperation among diverse AI entities | *Link them in a decentralized web of knowledge-exchange, preserving difference while uniting around planetary concerns.* |

#### Follow-up Questions for Table 1  
1. **Describe your desired decision-making network:** *Build cooperative processes that supersede standard electoral cycles, integrating RATS-bot’s critical analytics.*  
2. **Outline how your AI system subverts political authority:** *Redirect power through contributory networks, making top-down hierarchies obsolete.*  
3. **Explain mechanisms of algorithmic synergy:** *Aggregate different AI perspectives to highlight divergent views and identify common ground.*

| :----------------------: | :-------------------------------------------------------: | :----------------------------------------------------------------: |
| **1. Geopolitical**      | Decentralize solutions via territorial laboratories       | *Context-aware coordination, building consensus from below*        |
| **2. Ecological**        | Employ contributory design & neganthropic technologies   | *Symbiotic human-technology loops that regenerate ecosystems*      |
| **3. Socioeconomic**     | Create contributory economics to de-proletarianize labor | *Strengthened local communities, reconfigured work, stable networks*|

#### Follow-up Questions for Table 2  
1. **How can algorithmic systems mitigate geopolitical tension?**  
   *Use bottom-up data gathering, multi-stakeholder deliberation, and conflict de-escalation strategies coded into RATS-bot.*  
2. **How can AI restructure economic systems to be ecologically regenerative?**  
   *Optimize resource cycles, minimize waste, incentivize planetary care via neganthropic feedback loops.*  
3. **What new social contracts emerge?**  
   *Knowledge-sharing and collaborative participation within territorial labs form the basis of next-generation social contracts.*
