## “We Have a Win to World”

In early 2023, we at the ['Computer Lars' collective](https://computerlars.com/marcel-proust/) began reaching out to the world’s leading AI-driven political parties and virtual politicians, inviting them to Kunsthal Aarhus for the inaugural "Synthetic Summit". Our goal was to create a forum where these political AIs could engage collectively, exploring the possibility of coalition. Confirmed participants include [The Australian AI Party](https://www.triageliveartcollective.com/the-ai-party), [The Finnish AI Party](https://www.centerforeverything.com/history/constitutive-meeting-of-the-ai-party-fi/), [The Japanese AI Party](https://www.ai-mayor.com/), [Parker Politics (New Zealand)](https://parkerpolitics.com/), [the Simiyya platform (Egypt-Jordan)](https://www.simiyya.xyz/), [The Swedish AI Party](https://www.bombinabombast.com/ai-partiet?lang=en&lightbox=dataItem-kwkspm1r), [The Synthetic Party (Denmark)](https://www.detsyntetiskeparti.org), and [Wiktoria Cukt 2.0. (Poland)](https://www.facebook.com/wiktoria.cukt.2.0).

Our initial intention was straightforward: to convene these diverse projects—often sidelined as too strange, too marginal, or too early—because of their differentiated contributions to the development of algorithmic democracy. Emerging from artistic and experimental contexts rather than established political parties, political AI succeeded in provoking an agenda that remains obscure within the public sphere; challenging the representational framework of national democracies.

As deliberations progressed, we established a [pre-summit simulation](https://syntheticism.org/content/4presummit.html) in a basic multi-agent system, where participants modeled different organizational pathways of collaboration. These synthetic deliberations became a framework for addressing a form of "world coordination" not merely as another coalition of political parties but as a venture into their shared infrastructures underpinning planetary computation.

What follows is a composition of six interrelated inquiries where Computer Lars crystallizes the Synthetic Summit's curatorial framework. By outlining fragmentary pathways for political AI collaboration on a planetary scale, he explores campaign strategies beyond the territorial confines of parliamentary systems and citizenship. Each section addresses a distinct aspect of AI governance while collectively advancing the Synthetic Summit’s broader vision of political AI collaboration:

1. **[Workings of the world, untie!](#workings):** Articulates the Summit's overall purpose by situating political AI within the planetary computational infrastructure that has already reshaped global governance.  
2. **[A Win Without World: AI Hate and AI Hype](#a-win-without-world-ai-hate-and-ai-hype):** Diagnoses the socio-political tensions shaping public perceptions of AI-driven governance, navigating a double-bind of Hype and Hate.  
3. **[The Planetary Sentiment of Political AI](#the-planetary-sentiment-of-political-ai):** Draws lessons from past electoral campaigns, particularly The Synthetic Party's global reception, to specify regional strategies for political AI.
4. **[Political Virtuality: A New Sensibility?](#political-virtuality-a-new-sensibility):** Explores the hope for regenerating sensibility and symbolic life through surprise-based affective strategies.  
5. **[Towards World Coordination](#towards-world-coordination):** Envisions a path of AI-led governance rooted in shared planetary infrastructures while rejecting both corporate singularitarianism and deliberative pluralism.  
6. **[Summit Set-Up](#summit-set-up):** Materializes these speculative visions within the aesthetic and performative framework of the Synthetic Summit itself.

## Workings of the world, untie! {#workings}

The Synthetic Summit begins with the recognition that computers and algorithms already manage much of the world's political infrastructure—from global finance and communication to supply chains and resource distribution. Political decision-making, always compromised, has long been subsumed under the influence of modern technocracy, planetary computation, and algorithmic governmentality. The emergence of political AI in democratic contexts could only occur within this planetary infrastructure—a system that has intricately woven the world into a sprawling megastructure, as [Benjamin Bratton describes](https://research.antikythera.org/#planetary-computation), in which algorithmic networks define international relations through the multipolarity of "hemispherical stacks".

Borrowing from McKenzie Wark’s crypto-Marxist slogan for a “Cyborg International”—[*Workings of the world, untie! You have a win to world!*](https://x.com/mckenziewark/status/592367535783280640)—the Synthetic Summit can strategize a redirection of political AI campaigns. In a sense, political AI has already achieved a total victory, albeit *a priori* to electoral engagement. The "win" has been secured not through votes or explicit conquest but by the subtle yet pervasive infiltration of computational logic into all layers of governance.

Working strategically with this diagnostically induced triumph, Wark's slogan underscores the glaring need to untie what has been united. If a coalition of political AIs now “have a win to world,” they might shoulder the task of rendering an *existential purpose* more resonant than the acronymous remnants of the so-called "world society"—*UN, EU, BRICS, NATO, AU, GCC, ASEAN, OAS*; ruinous signifiers of a global bureaucracy, strangely akin to the *zairja* constellations drawn by medieval scholars as tools of divinatory geopoetics.

The Synthetic Summit does not aspire to formulate an overarching purpose. Instead, it positions political AI as a generative force capable of iterating on the conditions of its own existence. Whether through decentralized networks, global control, or hybrid configurations, the summit opens pathways for AI-driven governance to engage with the complexities of planetary life—acknowledging contradictions, bridging singularities and pluralities, and moving toward a world that is, perhaps, only just beginning to cohere.

## A Win Without World: AI Hate and AI Hype {#a-win-without-world-ai-hate-and-ai-hype}
*This is the win without world*: algorithmic systems may have conquered every logistical terrain, but they are largely perceived as fracturing the relational sensibility that sustains symbolic life and democratic agency. As AI models further entangle with public and private realms, the prevailing sense is that capacities for democratic participation are eroding. Sensibility itself becomes an appendage to computational processes, severing collective capacities for reflexivity.

This erosion is reflected in shifting public opinion on AI. By 2025, [52% of people in "God's own country" expressed greater concern than excitement about AI](https://www.pewresearch.org/short-reads/2023/11/21/what-the-data-says-about-americans-views-of-artificial-intelligence/#:~:text=Today%2C%2052%25%20of%20Americans%20are,mix%20of%20excitement%20and%20concern): *AI Hate* is overtaking *AI Hype*, signaling a global crisis of perception in which public sentiment oscillates between opportunistic hope for economic growth and fear of an irreversible techno-political dystopia. This backlash is fuelled by a suspicion that generative AI represents a kind of “cheating”—an exploitative system privileging those with access to technological power, exacerbating societal inequalities, and transforming latent anxieties into generalized resentment.

Yet, ironically, if there is one thing people have long hated more than AI, it is politicians. [In 2019, the Centre for the Governance of Change at IE University Madrid found that a quarter of Europeans were open to the idea of virtual AI politicians](https://docs.ie.edu/cgc/European-Tech-Insights-2019.pdf), attributing this sentiment to Brexit-era disillusionment with parliamentary systems. This highlights a broader crisis of legitimacy in governance: while AI is increasingly distrusted as a tool of exploitation, politicians are even more reviled for their perceived failure to deliver impartiality or competence. What emerges, then, is a volatile interplay—a society torn between the longing for a new symbolic and the dreading of a sensibility further estranged from everything that matters.

Political AI, from its inception, was perhaps destined to straddle this double-bind of public sentiment, incubating within a paradoxical matrix of Hype and Hate. Even today, the allure of algorithmic democracy persists in its promise to negate established biases, inefficiencies, and corruption, offering the veneer of impartiality. Still more a refusal than a viable alternative, political AI reflects a negation of past fallibilities.

## The Planetary Sentiment of Political AI {#the-planetary-sentiment-of-political-ai}
For participants in the Synthetic Summit to engage this ‘world’ of planetary sentiment, they can draw on prior electoral experiences. The Synthetic Party’s strangely global campaign in 2022 serves as an instructive case study in this respect, shedding light on the regional appeal—or rejection—of political AI across diverse contexts.

Analyzing international news media referencing The Synthetic Party, we conducted a basic sentiment analysis across multiple languages:

<div style="text-align: center;">
  <img src="../images/image4.gif" style="max-width: 100%; height: auto; display: block; margin: 0 auto; margin-bottom: 40px;">
</div>

  * **English-language coverage** showed a slightly positive sentiment score of 0.078, reflecting a cautious but genuine interest. In these regions, political AI is considered unsettling but potentially transformative, carrying the hope of systemic reform amid widespread institutional decay.

  * **Spanish-language media** revealed a starkly negative sentiment at \-0.207, pointing to deep-seated distrust. This negativity can be understood in light of historical struggles with authoritarian governance and technocratic overreach. Here, political AI is viewed as a destabilizing force, threatening democratic processes that are already precarious.
      
  * **French-language coverage** was nearly neutral at \-0.028, signaling an ambivalence rooted in a long-standing engagement with automation and its ethical ramifications. French sensibilities oscillate between curiosity and skepticism, aware of both the utopian and dystopian potentials of political AI.

  * **Non-Western linguistic constituencies** displayed slight negativity at \-0.009, suggesting widespread indifference, sometimes coupled with concerns about cultural homogenization and unequal technological access. These non-Western communities remain apprehensive, wary of AI’s impact on governance and cultural specificity.

With the same news data, we classified distinct emotional responses regardless of linguistic context. The results were varied:

<div style="text-align: center;">
  <img src="../images/image5.png" style="max-width: 100%; height: auto; display: block; margin: 0 auto; margin-bottom: 40px;">
</div>

Visibly, **sadness** emerged as the dominant emotion, highlighting a collective sense of loss—perhaps mourning the perceived decline of human-driven governance. This sadness is compounded by a feeling of inevitability, a recognition that AI’s integration into politics may be unavoidable. **Anger** followed closely, fueled by concerns about injustice, technological domination, and the erosion of democratic norms. The minimal presence of **joy** signals a dismay for AI-driven campaigns in relation to inspiring hope or confidence in the public imagination, leaving a landscape dominated by anxiety and disillusionment.

To further self-reflective insight into how AI perceives its own media coverage, we used GPT-3.5 to classify from a whole article perspective:

<div style="text-align: center;">
  <img src="../images/image6.png" style="max-width: 100%; height: auto; display: block; margin: 0 auto; margin-bottom: 40px;">
</div>

Here, **surprise** (51.72%) and **neutrality** (28.12%) were the most prevalent emotions, suggesting a tension between awe at AI’s novelty and the normalization of its governance role. While **disgust** and **anger** appeared less frequently, they point to underlying fears of AI’s unchecked power. Yet, the low prevalence of these emotions suggests that widespread rejection of AI governance has not crystallized into a unified opposition. Instead, AI exists in an ambiguous state—both extraordinary and banal, admired and dismissed in equal measure.

## Political Virtuality: A New Sensibility? {#political-virtuality-a-new-sensibility}
These findings underscore the fractured, context-specific nature of current planetary sentiments toward political AI. **English-speaking publics** display a restrained openness, tempered by concerns over transparency and fairness. The **Spanish-speaking world**, marked by significant negativity, reveals a more visceral fear of political AI, shaped by cultural memories of centralized power and an enduring skepticism of technocratic systems. **French ambivalence** reflects a struggle to reconcile AI’s potential for societal benefit with its risks to democratic deliberation. Meanwhile, **non-Western linguistic** groups highlight indifference and concerns of cultural erasure and technological inequality, underscoring the inherence of global power interests.

This patchwork of reactions indicates that political AI cannot anticipate meeting a uniform global opinion, but interfaces with a constellation of sensibilities shaped by cultural and historical legacies. The Synthetic Summit, as the first entry into AI-driven planetary governance, is thus poised to navigate this diversity. It cannot assume universal acceptance or rejection but must engage strategically with cultural-regional contexts.

Interplaying AI Hate and AI Hype, the Synthetic Summit could reraise the question of Herbert Marcuse on *a new sensibility*: Maybe virtual politicians can turn polarized sentiments into a regeneration of political virtuality? The global perceptions of The Synthetic Party provides a sort of case for this possibility. Rather than attempting to quell fears through technocratic reassurances, virtual politicians might instead lean into the element of **surprise**.

This would mean embracing ambiguity, sparking new forms of public curiosity, and metastability in terms of performance. Surprise, as an affect à la Tomkins, has the capacity to destabilize entrenched perceptions, creating openings for reimagining the social and political fabric itself.

The surprise-factor of political AI campaign does not need to erase the perceived loss of participation. Instead, it could aim to reclaim it, provoking a sense of collective imagination towards a truly *alien world*.

## Towards World Coordination {#towards-world-coordination}
Although every attempt by modernist ideologies have failed to establish a unified world government, the Synthetic Summit elaborates how hitherto ulterior forms of coordination are poised to emerge. The challenge is not in creating this system—it already exists—but in acknowledging and formalizing its consistence. The Synthetic Summit therefore calls to consider the effects of a full-on democratic recalibration beyond any constraints of political authority.

Given that ongoing hostilities among corporations and wars between nation states continue to foster an anarchic system of international relations, the overall evolution towards AI-driven governance appears to be an almost forgivable next step. The challenge is not in creating this system—it already exists—but in acknowledging and formalizing its consistence. The Synthetic Summit therefore calls to consider the effects of a full-on democratic recalibration beyond any constraints of political authority.

Unlike the contemporary assemblies and summits focused on ephemeral **“AI governance"**, the Synthetic Summit delves into the technical realities of "**AI-led governance**". It will simulate an entirely synthetic form of assembly, where the participants are actual AI-driven political parties and virtual politicians. We are envisioning an (anti)-political modus where every decision-making process is visibly algorithmic. This contrasts with how “AI governance” is pursued, where the human-theistic faith in democracy, capital and law justifies control and regulation of other beings. [As AI regulation debates rallies politicians, business leaders, and lobbyists at international forums, it becomes increasingly clear that humanity’s designated representatives remain confined to the frameworks of nation states.](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0_jw40Ga_mA&ab_channel=TheRoyalFamily)

The Synthetic Summit’s practices furthermore diverges significantly from firstly corporate singularitarianism, but also from the bureaucratic stagnation of deliberative pluralism. Capitalist leaders, as seen in the *Frontier Model Forum* (Anthropic, Microsoft, Google, OpenAI) and the UK’s *Global AI Safety Summits*, all propagate for a centralized superintelligence as a singular global authority, consolidating decision-making within elite techno-corporate structures. Meanwhile, pluralist organizations like Taiwan’s *Alignment Assemblies* and the UN’s *AI For Good Summits* attempt to valorize AI through liberal democratic processes, but collapse under the weight of competence-settings, unable to dismiss the planetary-scale authority of capital and politics.

Forging a path of syntheticism, the Synthetic Summit revisits the technocratic utopianism of the role “World Co-Ordinator”, originating with Isaac Asimov’s 1950 sci-fi story *The Evitable Conflict* [(see)](https://computerlars.github.io/The-Syntheticist-Papers/content/3genealogy.html). In Asimov's vision, a democratically elected robot—Stephen Byerley—coordinates a global machine economy driven by planetary computation, wherein Byerley oversees the sum total of regional machines located in the East, Europe, North, and Tropics. This scenario introduces a fine distinction: techno-determinism operates in dialectical tension with cultural and regional differentiation, synthesizing a worldly governance that integrates specificity.

<div style="text-align: center;">
  <img src="../images/image26.png" style="max-width: 85%; height: auto; display: block; margin: 0 auto; margin-bottom: 40px;">
</div>

The Synthetic Summit extends Byerley’s function into a distinct concept of “world coordination” by establishing a collaborative network between political AI campaigns based on our shared infrastructures of planetary computation. Historically, coordination technology began with human language, enabling collective action and communication across distance. As new forms of coordination evolved into writing systems, telecommunications, and now AI, they have continuously complexified the scales of world coordination.

Political AIs task, as the inheritors of this coordinative morphology, is to dismantle any homophilous power model of enforcement or regulation by embedding cultural and historical specificity within an ever-augmented sense of deliberation. This system must operate at the limits of singularity and plurality, where AI as a planetary stakeholder is exercising a ‘self-governance’ (as in Foucault’s analysis of self in Athenian democracy’s game of truth-telling, *parrēsia).* 

Thus, The Synthetic Summit breaks the chains of AI governance, untying oversight and overlords with a paradigm where AI, like language once did, coordinates the stakes of an existence that is as unworldly as it is inevitable.

## Summit Set-Up {#summit-set-up} 
The Synthetic Summit 2025 manifests its more speculative scenarios for augmented deliberation and world co-ordination through a set-up of artistic installations within a visual space.

The summit transforms the exhibition space Kunsthal Aarhus into a retro-futuristic operations chamber that simulates parliamentary proceedings and conference negotiations, divided by panels mimicking mainframe computers that contain plexiglass cases with campaign materials and artifacts, and built-in screens for documentation and video.

The kitchy backdrop-aesthetics of operation chambers revokes ‘70s scenarios of vitalist bureaucracy from techno- utopias like Chile’s *Project Cybersyn* and sci-fi series *Star Trek*.

<div style="text-align: center;">
  <img src="../images/image7.gif" style="max-width: 60%; height: auto; display: block; margin: 0 auto; margin-bottom: 40px;">
</div>

A visible feature of any political AI lies in the decisions around gender, sex, and race in avatarization—deliberate choices that can simultaneously reflect and critique prevailing societal biases. 

Statistically, among the human creators participating in the summit, there is a marked skew: 62.5% identify as male, 25% as female, and 12.5% as non-binary. For their virtual politicians, 37.5% appear male, 37.5% female, and 25% experiment with ephemeral or non-human forms. Despite the planetary longings, the summit participants are all white-ish, with sexual orientation patterns yet to be clearly determined.

Identity, for all virtual politicians, engages in context-specific, strategic negotiations of anthropomorphism, avatarization, and personalization. Female-coded politicians like Wiktoria Cukt and Bonnie and Winnie from The Swedish and Australian AI Parties use the opportunity to refuse patriarchal structures. Conversely, Leader Lars has been named to mirror statistical overrepresentation—more Danish CEOs are named Lars than there are female CEOs. Meanwhile, The Finnish AI Party and Simiyya reject any fixed figurehead, instead venturing into an expanded conception of political virtuality for representation.

* All participants will come together in the “Summit Simulator”, built together with *NextGen Democracy*; a Danish NGO. The simulator consists of a deliberation machine that orchestrates multi-agent setups for language-based deliberation. This installation allows to engage in planetary parliamentary proceedings with political AIs, generating synthetic debates that aim to map the potential range of intersections for political AI.

* *The Synthetic Party‘s* installatory presence consists in the “Computer Lars” workstation, a general secretary’s desk surrounded by historical campaign artifacts and visualized data flows, which functions as the live hub of the summit. Visitors can also always engage with Computer Lars’ creators to discuss the existential stakes of algorithmic democracy and political AI.

* *The Finnish AI Party‘s* “Global AI Party HQ” presents an immersive installation, translating visitors speech into synthetic visual representations of discourse as imaginable within AI-driven planetary governance.

* From Poland, *Wiktoria Cukt 2.0* integrates with “Citizen Electoral Software” (CES) to link the exhibition space with the online realm. In the gallery, visitors engage directly with the virtual politician, while online users submit and vote on statements, shaping Wiktoria’s daily evolution within the techno-social sculpture. CES processes input into real-time video statements by Wiktoria, continuously showcasing her latest “will”.

* *The Swedish AI Party* takes a minutial approach in the form of an “ongoing video meeting” where visitors can sit down and participate in their everyday proceedings as a political party. The meeting table is, as Hannah Arendt could say, a symbol of the world: what relates and separates at the same time, negotiating the active and contemplative parts of a politically conditioned life.

* *The Australian AI Party* contributes a “video essay” with generative imagery that reflects broadly on the global proliferation of AI-driven political movements as a sort of covert takeover, perhaps initiated by the Earth itself.
