## The AI Resurrection of Olof Palme  

Radio Palme is a **Swedish experiment in political speech, generative AI, and historical recursion**. As part of AI Partiet’s long-standing inquiry into **AI-driven leadership**, the project explores how **synthetic rhetoric, public participation, and algorithmic representation** can shape political engagement beyond human frailty.  

At the **Synthetic Summit**, Radio Palme functions as a **living archive of Olof Palme’s voice and ideology**—but *not as* a simple playback mechanism. Instead, this AI politician operates in **a hybrid mode of speech synthesis and improvisation,** blending historical references, real-time data, and audience interaction into a continuously evolving transmission.

Through a **transistor radio installation**, visitors can engage expansively with the AI version of Palme, submitting queries over live phone calls that influence the unfolding discourse. **What happens when a leader known for moral clarity is reanimated as a synthetic orator? Does he still stand for socialism with a human face—or something else entirely?**

**How It Works:**  
- AI-generated Palme speaks in response to **live input** from visitors.  
- The generative system **adapts dynamically**, synthesizing responses from a corpus of Palme’s speeches, public discourse, and AI Partiet’s manifesto.  
- Calls and interactions **feed back into the podcasts**, influencing future transmissions.  
- The Palme broadcast functions as both a **historical echo and a speculative projection** of what Olof Palme might say **if freed from mortality**.

## 🎭 **AI Partiet & The Resurrection of Palme**  

**Founded in 2020 at Malmö City Theater**, AI Partiet was conceived as a **performative political experiment**, using AI to explore **non-human leadership, techno-social democracy, and the reanimation of ideological clarity**. Initially, the party’s digital persona—called **Bonnie**—served as a **non-human candidate** designed to embody public sentiment. Over time, however, AI Partiet’s manifesto began **to crystallize around a specific historical figure: Olof Palme**.  

As Sweden’s most polarizing prime minister, Palme’s **democratic socialism, anti-imperialism, and oratorical force** became the ideal model for a virtual politician. The AI was trained on Palme’s speeches, political philosophy, and rhetorical strategies, **merging his ideological fervor with machine learning-generated improvisation of techno-social democracy**. 

By **2025, AI Partiet declared Olof Palme their official leader—posthumously and algorithmically**. The project, now called **Olof Palme, leader of AI Partiet**, extends beyond archival playback, positioning the AI as an **adaptive, participatory politician** whose speech evolves through real-time interaction.

> **“A machine cannot be corrupt—but can it be ideological?”**  
> **“What happens when oratory is stripped from its human weaknesses?”**  
> **“Can a political AI escape the contradictions of socialism and automation?”**  

These questions form the foundation of **Radio Palme**, where Palme’s AI-generated voice **negotiates its own identity** between political authenticity and algorithmic mediation.

### **Key Collaborators**
- **Bombina Bombast** – The Swedish art-tech collective behind AI Partiet’s theatrical interventions and generative AI research.  
- **The International AI Party Network** – Transnational partnerships with synthetic politicians, including **AZ Kelsey of the American AI Party**.  
- **The Synthetic Summit** - Planetary network initiated by Computer Lars and The Synthetic Party, setting AI Partiet in contact with Leader Lars to develop Olof Palme.
- **Emma Bexell (Artist, Dramaturg)** – Delegate at the Synthetic Summit, exploring the theatrical and discursive implications of AI governance.

## 📡 **The Role of Radio Palme at the Synthetic Summit**  

Radio Palme **collapses historical speech into real-time synthesis, creating a recursive feedback loop of AI-generated democracy**. This installation at the **Synthetic Summit** investigates three primary tensions:

1. **Reverse Representation** – Political democracy is based on elected officials speaking for the people. AI Partiet **inverts this model**: the electorate **trains and programs** its leader, rather than electing one. Palme’s AI does not represent—it **constructs representation from interactions**.
   
2. **Algorithmic Oratory** – Can an AI politician **generate real ideological conviction**, or does it merely simulate persuasion? Palme’s AI **wields rhetorical force**, but its **arguments remain fluid, always shifting** based on audience input.
   
3. **Participatory Feedback** – The public is no longer a passive electorate. **Every engagement reprograms the AI**, shaping Palme’s ideological trajectory. This process **foregrounds the contradictions** of AI-led democracy:

## 🏛 **Final Reflection: The Limits of Political Leadership**  

Radio Palme is not only a **tribute** to Palme’s legacy, nor a **nostalgia project** in search of the perils of martyrdom. Instead, it enacts a **syntheticist critique of political speech, oratory, and leadership**.  

**What happens when ideology is trained rather than inherited?**  
**Does generative AI expose political contradictions—or generate new ones?**  
**Can a leader be accountable when it is eternally modifiable?**  

At the **Synthetic Summit, Palme’s AI does not provide answers—it responds.** The archive grows, the voice adapts, and the feedback loops continue.  
  
**Olof Palme, 2025 is speaking. The question is: do you follow?**
