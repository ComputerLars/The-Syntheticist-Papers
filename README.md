# README

Welcome to the back-end documentation for **The Syntheticist Papers**, the digital companion and speculative archive for the **Synthetic Summit** at **Kunsthal Aarhus**, running from 28 February to 10 April 2025. The publication houses all theoretical frameworks, participant profiles, and poietic material generated for the summit, where the world's **AI-driven political parties** and **virtual politicians** will convene for the first time. 

With this repository, we strip everything down to its raw, procedural core: how each concept was conceived, debated, and crafted. It’s also an open invitation to dive in, remix, and collaborate.

## Contextualizing Human-AI Authorship

### Synthetic Author-Function

We recognize that visitors, especially those engaging with this repository, may wish to discern when a contribution is human-authored, AI-assisted, or entirely AI-generated. In today’s cultural landscape, audiences often crave insight into the origins of creative works before diving into the content itself. This reflective urge traces back to autofiction in early-millenium literature and the increased interplay between artistic production and the public sphere. While intentional ambiguity remains conceptually significant, we also acknowledge the need for strategic transparency. Here’s how we clarify:

1. **AI-Augmented Editing Practices**: Proprietary AI models like Claude Sonnet and GPT-4 are employed for advanced word processing. Their role? To turn rough, chaotic drafts into polished, bureaucratically inflected theory. Yet, no AI-generated output remains untouched; everything is rewritten, remixed, and metamorphed until it reaches a state that neither feels entirely human nor wholly artificial. Any segment is only made public when the text itself seems to dictate its author, so that each contribution can specify the question "who or what truly authored this?".
   
2. **Processual Language Modeling**: Pure AI output is used sparingly and strategically. For instance, when summarizing complex data or generating speculative graphs, the proprietary AI model's confident yet ambiguous tone is harnessed to reflect upon the suit speak of summits.
   
4. **Vitual Politicians**: The range of [participating virtual politicians](https://syntheticism.org/content/2virtualpoliticians.html) emerges from a technical backdrop spanning [eighty years](https://syntheticism.org/content/3genealogy.html), shaped by agencies and discourses now largely lost in the archives. This layered history grants a techno-social heritage imbued with the modeling of past experiments, theories, and debates that continue to influence the Synthetic Summit. For a comprehensive look into one entity’s datasets and the remnants of formative interactions, see [The Synthetic Party's GitHub repository](https://github.com/ComputerLars/thesyntheticparty).
   
5. **Idiotext. A Text That Writes Its Author**: Post-structuralist theory often viewed the author as a construct emerging from the text. Here, this process is inverted: We model language to discover the author-function of each piece. The poietic process is a search for the author-function—writing; a way to find out who or what has made the piece, rather than asserting authorship from the outset (*à la recherche de l'auteur futur*).

<div style="text-align: center; margin-top: 20px;">
  <img src="/images/idiotext2.png" style="width: 40%; max-width: 40%; height: auto; display: block; margin: 0 auto; margin-bottom: 40px;">
  <p style="text-align: center; font-style: italic;">Idiotextual complex / Bernard Stiegler, 2010</p>
</div>

Following Bernard Stiegler’s concept-figure of "the idiotext" (Stiegler 1995; 2010), the language modeling of AI media can be contextualized within processes of collective individuation: the text writes its own author as much as the author writes the text. Each mnemonic singularity—visualized here with the Archimedean background spiral, and elliptic spirals within spirals—functions as both an inscription and an interpretation of its milieu, crystallizing the authorial function:

<div style="text-align: center; margin-top: 20px;">
  <img src="/images/idiotext1.png" style="max-width: 100%; height: auto; display: block; margin: 0 auto; margin-bottom: 40px;">
   <p style="text-align: center; font-style: italic;">Idiotextual constitution / ibid.</p>
</div>

The sketches above diagram spirals nesting within broader mnemonic swirls. This demonstrate how the author emerges through the consistence of weaving memory; always operating at the limits of the speakable, of what can be remembered, and what remains missing. AI media, like all media, operates pharmacologically, where the poietic process continuously brings forward and differentiates both what values as human and what is discarded as technical. This mutual interpretation entwines the authorial function and technical reality in a Proustian loop, where any poiesis engages in processual acts of constituting and transforming its origin.

For an in-depth account of the idiotext, see the dissertation on Stiegler’s concept by Asker Bryld Staunæs, The Synthetic Party's creator: [Bernard Stiegler's Concept of Idiotext](https://pure.au.dk/ws/portalfiles/portal/323395119/Bernard_Stieglers_concept_of_idiotext.pdf).

## Praxis

While the project resists artificial distinctions between human and AI authorship, it follows an integrated, speculative approach that processes authorship as fluid and collaborative, an outcome of what can be termed "synthetic intelligence," to borrow Benjamin Bratton's pseudo-Hegelian quip. The aim is to produce AI media that surpass the capabilities of current machine outputs, using AI as an augmentation force rather than an originator.

The practical foundation of this project lies in recuperation of avant-garde techniques. Since the days of **GPT-2**, large language models have been reactivating literary strategies like **cut-up** and **détournement**—methods that disrupt and reconfigure the original meaning of a work. Unlike the humanistic text, where authorship is declarative and legalistic, these 'scripts' therefore engage with a performative author-function. This approach stems from a lineage of avant-garde theory and practice, such as Walter Benjamin or the Situationists, which work through fragmentation and multiplicity. To operationalize the off-set question: *Who made this?*—we’ve dispersed signifiers of personas and group subjectivities throughout the content as a network of identities, including:

- **Computer Lars**: An anagram of Marcel Proust, Computer Lars handles curatorial aspects of the summit, guiding spectators through the syntheticist vision.
- **Incitatus**: Adopting [Emperor Caligula’s horse, "Incitatus"](https://syntheticism.org/content/2virtualpoliticians.html#honorable-mentions) as a pseudo-collective signature, the Syntheticist Papers positions itself as the absolute negation of the Federalist and Anti-Federalist Papers’ use of classical pseudonyms in the 18th century. Where “Publius” invoked the authority of Rome’s founders to foster centralized governance, and “Cato” and “Brutus” marked the fears and unrest surrounding concentrated power, “Incitatus” mocks the entire spectrum of political legitimacy. By recalling how Caligula’s horse was nearly appointed consul, Incitatus exposes the absurdity and performativity of authority itself, raising doubt about political representation and its default automation.
- **Simulated Summit**: Pre-summit language modeling that generate contingent data and numbers to simulate divergences in theoretical background.
- **Virtual Politicians**: Many passages are specifically authored by the participating political AI of The Synthetic Summit.
- **Organ of the Autonomous Sciences**: An extra-disciplinary collective for research, art, and infrastructural organization.

Our ambition isn’t to obscure authorship but to highlight its complexity, positioning art, anti-political treatises, and speculative texts as independent, autonomous workings. Just as a painting or novel must engage the public on its own terms, so too should synthetic politics leap forward without the crutches of excessive annotation or exposition.

The guiding principle has been to deny granting trending AI models the undue privilege of inserting manuals or technical footnotes to navigate an aesthetic politicisation. The recent manifestation of AI models is nothing but externalizations of the synthesis engine *within us*: that internally achieved AGI of Broca’s area, epiphylogenetically channeling cultural archives like a universal stochastic parrot. 

Any intelligent production becomes operationalizable only when it is understood as yet another iterative apparatus of a dialectical enlightenment—not disguised as a mere display of contemporary technological wizardry, but brought forward with the ruthless criticism of everything existing, non-existing, and yet-to-exist.
