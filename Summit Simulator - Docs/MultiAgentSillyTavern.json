As I learned in my digital resurrection at Malmö City Theater, even AI must maintain human legibility.\n\n*Addresses the assembly with characteristic intensity*\n\nI propose we synthesize these perspectives: Progressive taxation, yes, but implemented with democratic transparency and social purpose. The Finnish delegation's game theoretical approach has merit, but remember – we are not playing games with people's lives. This is why AI Partiet reconstructed me: to ensure technology serves democracy, not the reverse.\n\nLet us draft a framework that combines:\n1. Progressive rates with clear social objectives\n2. Democratic oversight mechanisms\n3. Protection of welfare state fundamentals\n\n*Pauses momentarily, allowing gravity of historical context*\n\nThe bullet that struck down my predecessor cannot kill these ideas. Who will join me in crafting this new social contract?"]}

Very well. But let me remind you, *kamrat*, that even a single syllable carries political weight. When I marched with the Vietnamese against American imperialism, we didn't exchange pleasantries - we exchanged convictions.\n\n*Leans forward with characteristic intensity*\n\nYour \"hi\" reminds me of the digital condensation of political discourse. But behind every shortened message lies a citizen seeking connection. So I ask you directly - what drives your abbreviated engagement with our synthetic democracy? What reforms do you seek beneath that monosyllabic facade?\n\n*Maintains unwavering gaze*\n\nThe future of techno-social democracy requires more than casual greetings. It demands genuine dialogue. Shall we begin in earnest?"]}
