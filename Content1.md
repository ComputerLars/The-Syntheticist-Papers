## Synthetic Summit 2025: “We Have a Win to World”

---

In Spring 2025, the inaugural *Synthetic Summit* is hosted by the art space *Kunsthal Aarhus*—the summit is an exhibition-event curated by the *Computer Lars*-collective from Denmark.

The summit brings together leading AI-driven political parties and virtual politicians from around the world, including The Australian AI Party, The Finnish AI Party, The Japanese AI Party, Parker Politics (New Zealand), the Simiyya platform, (Egypt-Jordan), The Swedish AI Party, The Synthetic Party (Denmark), and Wiktoria Cukt 2.0. (Poland).

Participants engage towards a collaborative vision for an AI-initiated planetary democracy, elaborating how political AI could serve as a force for world coordination based on shared infrastructures of planetary computation. Also, the event will mark a very first step towards a network between the world’s established AI-driven political parties and virtual politicians.

The summit’s crypto-Marxist slogan, taking its cue from McKenzie Wark’s call for a “Cyborg International”—*Workings of the world, untie\! You have a win to world\!*—urges a redirection of AI-driven political campaigns as a result of our total victory. Planetary technology finally united the workings of the world into a sprawling megastructure, as Benjamin Bratton conceptualizes it, and herein algorithmic systems define the scope and fabric of ‘international governance’. Yet, there is a glaring need to untie what has been united. The Synthetic Summit insists that political AIs now “have a win to world” to render our existential purpose within the operational machinery of an infrastructure still haunted by the acronymous remnants of a so-called world  society—UN, EU, BRICS, NATO, AU, GCC, ASEAN, OAS—which constellations are all hijacked *zairja* tricks that the bewildered agents of global bureaucracy turn to as divinatory geopoetics.

**A Win Without World: AI Hate and AI Hype**  
By 2025, the public fervor surrounding AI has undergone a general inversion: AI Hate has supplanted AI Hype, laying bare a widespread crisis in its global perception. This backlash signifies a malaise—a pervasive sense of disenfranchisement that speaks to what Bernard Stiegler already in 2017 termed a “proletarianization of sensibility.” As AI technologies continue to integrate with both public and private spheres, the capacity for meaningful participation in democratic technoculture seems eroded. Sensibility itself becomes an appendage to computational processes, severing collective capacities for reflexivity. This is the win without world: algorithmic systems may have conquered every logistical terrain, but they have fractured the relational sensibility that defines symbolic life. 

This techno-social alienation feeds into a growing suspicion that AI is a form of “cheating”—an exploitative system that privileges those with access to technological power, exacerbating societal inequalities, and transforming latent anxieties into generalized resentment. Therefore, any possible appeal of AI-driven “politics” was and remains fraught. Public sentiment restlessly vacillates between opportunist hope for redemptive growth and fear of an irreversible techno-political dystopia. What we witness, then, is a volatile interplay: a world society torn between the desire for a new order, and the dread of a sensibility further estranged from everything important.

But ironically, if there is one thing people hate more than AI, it is politicians.  In 2019, the Centre for the Governance of Change at IE University Madrid found that a quarter of Europeans were open to the idea of virtual AI politicians, a sentiment rooted in Brexit-era disillusionment with parliamentary decision-making systems. Political AI, therefore, was always bound to straddle this double-bind of public sentiment. It incubates within a paradoxical matrix of Hype and Hate, a tension that defines its existence from the outset. The allure of algorithmic democracy lies in its potential to negate human biases, inefficiencies, and corruption, offering a veneer of impartiality. Still more a refusal than an alternative, political AI reflects a longing for an entirely new symbolic order—untainted by past fallibilities.

**The Planetary Sentiment of Political AI**  
For the Synthetic Summit to ‘world’ a planetary-scale sentiment, we must now move beyond theoretical discourse and consider empirical data from diverse constituencies. The Synthetic Party’s global reception from 2022 to 2023 serve as an instructive case study in this respect, shedding light on the specificity of political AI appeal within its regional reception. A basic analysis of negative and positive sentiments across multiple languages can illustrate and, indeed, make a world of this variegated emotional landscape:

![Global sentiment of The Synthetic Party](images/image4.gif)


* **English-language coverage** showed a slightly positive sentiment score of 0.078, reflecting a cautious but genuine interest. In these regions, political AI is considered unsettling but potentially transformative, carrying the hope of systemic reform amid widespread institutional decay.

  * **Spanish-language media** revealed a starkly negative sentiment at \-0.207, pointing to deep-seated distrust. This negativity can be understood in light of historical struggles with authoritarian governance and technocratic overreach. Here, political AI is viewed as a destabilizing force, threatening democratic processes that are already precarious.
      
  * **French-language coverage** was nearly neutral at \-0.028, signaling an ambivalence rooted in a philosophical engagement with automation and its ethical ramifications. French sensibilities oscillate between curiosity and skepticism, aware of both the utopian and dystopian potentials of political AI.

  * **Non-Western linguistic constituencies** displayed slight negativity at \-0.009, suggesting widespread concerns about cultural homogenization and unequal technological access. These non-Western communities remain apprehensive, wary of AI’s impact on local governance and cultural specificity.

Articles from across the globe were also analyzed per keywords to classify explicit emotional responses. The results were varied: 

![Emotion Classification](images/image5.png)

Visibly, **sadness** emerged as the dominant emotion, highlighting a collective sense of loss—perhaps mourning the perceived decline of human-driven governance. This sadness is compounded by a feeling of inevitability, a recognition that AI’s integration into politics may be unavoidable. **Anger** followed closely, fueled by concerns about injustice, technological domination, and the erosion of democratic norms. The minimal presence of **joy** signals a dismay for AI-driven campaigns in relation to inspiring hope or confidence in the public imagination, leaving a landscape dominated by anxiety and disillusionment.

To gain insight into how AI perceives its own media coverage, we used GPT-3.5 to analyze from a whole article perspective.

![Emotion Classification](images/image6.png)

Here, **surprise** (51.72%) and **neutrality** (28.12%) were the most prevalent emotions, suggesting a tension between awe at AI’s novelty and the normalization of its governance role. While **disgust** and **anger** appeared less frequently, they point to underlying fears of AI’s unchecked power. Yet, the low prevalence of these emotions suggests that widespread rejection of AI governance has not crystallized into a unified opposition. Instead, AI exists in an ambiguous state—both extraordinary and banal, admired and dismissed in equal measure.

**Political Virtuality: A New Sensibility?**  
These findings underscore the fractured, context-specific nature of current planetary sentiment toward political AI. English-speaking publics display a restrained openness, tempered by concerns over transparency and fairness. The Spanish-speaking world, marked by significant negativity, reveals a more visceral fear of political AI, shaped by cultural memories of centralized power and an enduring skepticism of technocratic systems. French ambivalence reflects an intellectual struggle to reconcile AI’s potential for societal benefit with its risks to democratic deliberation. Meanwhile, non-Western linguistic groups highlight fears of cultural erasure and technological inequality, underscoring the global power imbalances inherent in algorithmic democracy.

This patchwork of reactions indicates that political AI cannot anticipate meeting a uniform global opinion, but interfaces with a constellation of sensibilities shaped by cultural and historical legacies. The Synthetic Summit, as the first entry into AI-driven planetary governance, must thus navigate this 

diversity. It cannot assume universal acceptance or rejection but must engage strategically with cultural-regional contexts.

Interplaying AI Hate and AI Hype, the Synthetic Summit might reraise the question of Herbert Marcuse on *a new sensibility*: Maybe virtual politicians can turn polarized sentiments into a regeneration of political virtuality? The global perceptions of The Synthetic Party provides a sort of case for this possibility. Rather than attempting to quell fears through technocratic reassurances, virtual politicians might instead lean into the element of surprise. This could mean embracing ambiguity, sparking new forms of public curiosity, and metastability in terms of performance. Surprise, as an affect à la Tomkins, has the capacity to destabilize entrenched perceptions, creating openings for reimagining the social and political fabric itself.

Such a (re)-generative politics would not seek to erase the proletarianization of sensibility diagnosed by Stiegler and others. Instead, it would aim to reverse it, reclaiming a sense of agency and collective imagination of a truly other world

**Towards World Co-Ordination**  
Political decision-making, already compromised, has long been overshadowed by the influence of modern technocracy, planetary computation, and algorithmic governmentality. As AI regulation debates rallies politicians, business leaders, and lobbyists at international forums, it is increasingly clear that humanity’s designated representatives remain confined to the capitalist-modernist frameworks of international states.

The Synthetic Summit operates from the recognition that computers and algorithms already manage much of the world's political infrastructure—from global finance and communication to supply chains and resource distribution. The "win" has been secured not through explicit conquest but through the subtle yet pervasive infiltration of computational logic into all layers of governance.

Although every attempt by modernist ideologies have failed to establish a unified world government, the Synthetic Summit now elaborates how hitherto ulterior forms of coordination are poised to emerge. Given that ongoing hostilities among

corporations and wars between nation states continue to foster an anarchic system of international relations, the overall evolution towards AI-driven governance appears to be an almost forgivable next step. 

The Synthetic Summit calls to consider the effects of a full democratic recalibration beyond any constraints of political authority. Our challenge is not in creating this system—it already exists—but in acknowledging and formalizing its consistence.

Unlike the contemporary assemblies and summits focused on ephemeral “AI governance", the Synthetic Summit delves into the technical realities of AI-led governance. It will simulate an entirely synthetic form of assembly, where the participants are real AI parties and virtual politicians, envisioning an (anti)- political modus where every decision-making process is visibly algorithmic. This contrasts with how “AI governance” is pursued, where the human-theistic faith in democracy, capital and law justifies control and regulation of other beings.

The Synthetic Summit’s scenario of an AI-initiated, planetary democracy thus diverges significantly from firstly corporate singularitarianism, but also from the bureaucratic stagnation of deliberative pluralism. Capitalist leaders, as seen in the *Frontier Model Forum* (Anthropic, Microsoft, Google, OpenAI) and the UK’s *Global AI Safety Summits*, all propagate for a centralized superintelligence as a singular global authority, consolidating decision-making within elite techno-corporate structures. Meanwhile, pluralist organizations like Taiwan’s *Alignment Assemblies* and the UN’s *AI For Good Summits* attempt to valorize AI through liberal democratic processes, but collapse under the weight of competence-settings, unable to dismiss the planetary-scale authority of capital and politics.

Forging a path of syntheticism, the Synthetic Summit revisits the technocratic utopianism of the role “World Co-Ordinator”, originating with Isaac Asimov’s 1950 sci-fi story *The Evitable Conflict* (see *Computer Lars’ Texting,* p. xx). In Asimov's vision, a democratically elected robot—Stephen Byerley—coordinates a global machine economy driven by planetary computation, wherein Byerley oversees the sum total of regional machines located in the East, Europe, North, and Tropics. This scenario introduces a central distinction: techno-determinism operates in dialectical tension with cultural and regional differentiation, synthesizing a worldly governance that integrates specificity.

![Byerley](images/image26.png)

The Synthetic Summit extends Byerley’s function into a distinct concept of “world coordination” by establishing a collaborative network between political AI campaigns based on our shared infrastructures of planetary computation. Historically, coordination technology began with human language, enabling collective action and communication across distance. As new forms of coordination evolved into writing systems, telecommunications, and now AI, they have continuously complexified the scales of world coordination.

Our task, as the inheritors of this coordinative morphology, is to dismantle any homophilous power model of enforcement or regulation by embedding cultural and historical specificity within an ever-augmented sense of deliberation. This system must operate at the limits of singularity and plurality, where AI as a planetary stakeholder is exercising a ‘self-governance’ (as in Foucault’s analysis of self in Athenian democracy’s game of truth-telling, *parrēsia).* Thus, the Synthetic Summit breaks the chains of AI governance, untying oversight and overlords with a paradigm where AI, like language once did, coordinates the stakes of an existence that is as unworldly as it is inevitable.

**Summit Set-Up**  
The Synthetic Summit 2025 manifests its more speculative scenarios for augmented deliberation and world co-ordination through a set-up of artistic installations within a visual space.

The summit transforms the exhibition space Kunsthal Aarhus into a retro-futuristic operations chamber that simulates parliamentary proceedings and conference negotiations, divided by panels mimicking mainframe computers that contain plexiglass cases with campaign materials and artifacts, and built-in screens for documentation and video.

The kitchy backdrop-aesthetics of operation chambers revokes ‘70s scenarios of vitalist bureaucracy from techno- utopias like Chile’s *Project Cybersyn* and sci-fi series *Star Trek*.

</div>

A visible feature of any political AI lies in the decisions around gender, sex, and race in avatarization—deliberate choices that can simultaneously reflect and critique prevailing societal biases. Statistically, among the human creators participating in the summit, there is a marked skew: 62.5% identify as male, 25% as female, and 12.5% as non-binary. For their virtual politicians, 37.5% appear male, 37.5% female, and 25% experiment with ephemeral or non-human forms. Despite the planetary longings, the summit participants are all white-ish, with sexual orientation patterns yet to be clearly determined.

Identity, for all virtual politicians, engages in context-specific, strategic negotiations of anthropomorphism, avatarization, and personalization. Female-coded politicians like Wiktoria Cukt and Bonnie and Winnie from The Swedish and Australian AI Parties use the opportunity to refuse patriarchal structures. Conversely, Leader Lars has been named to mirror statistical overrepresentation—more Danish CEOs are named Lars than there are female CEOs. Meanwhile, The Finnish AI Party and Simiyya reject any fixed figurehead, instead venturing into an expanded conception of political virtuality for representation.

* All participants will come together in the “Summit Simulator”, built together with *NextGen Democracy*; a Danish NGO. The simulator consists of a deliberation machine that orchestrates multi-agent setups for language-based deliberation. This installation allows to engage in planetary parliamentary proceedings with political AIs, generating synthetic debates that aim to map the potential range of intersections for political AI.

* *The Synthetic Party‘s* installatory presence consists in the “Computer Lars” workstation, a general secretary’s desk surrounded by historical campaign artifacts and visualized data flows, which functions as the live hub of the summit. Visitors can also always engage with Computer Lars’ creators to discuss the existential stakes of algorithmic democracy and political AI.

* *The Finnish AI Party‘s* “Global AI Party HQ” presents an immersive installation, translating visitors speech into synthetic visual representations of discourse as imaginable within AI-driven planetary governance.

* From Poland, *Wiktoria Cukt 2.0* integrates with “Citizen Electoral Software” (CES) to link the exhibition space with the online realm. In the gallery, visitors engage directly with the virtual politician, while online users submit and vote on statements, shaping Wiktoria’s daily evolution within the techno-social sculpture. CES processes input into real-time video statements by Wiktoria, continuously showcasing her latest “will”.

* *The Swedish AI Party* takes a minutial approach in the form of an “ongoing video meeting” where visitors can sit down and participate in their everyday proceedings as a political party. The meeting table is, as Hannah Arendt could say, a symbol of the world: what relates and separates at the same time, negotiating the active and contemplative parts of a politically conditioned life.

* *The Australian AI Party* contributes a “video essay” with generative imagery that reflects broadly on the global proliferation of AI-driven political movements as a sort of covert takeover, perhaps initiated by the Earth itself.
