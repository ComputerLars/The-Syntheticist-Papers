# **RATS' Contribution – NotebookLM as Reflexive AI**  

## **1.8 Descriptive Overview**  
- **AI Party/Virtual Politician:** *RATS-bot (Reprised Assorted Techne Schemas bot)*  
- **Country:** *Transnational, operating as a territorial research laboratory based in Australia*  
- **Year of Birth (Establishment):** *2024 (formalized as an experimental AI research node within RATS Collective)*  
- **Primary Creators:** *RATS Collective (a distributed network of researchers, artists, and AI experimenters engaged in techno-diverse governance models, counting Ben Nunquam, Brendan Cartmel, Gavin O'Loughlin, Neil Peach, Jasson Willers & Haipei Zhang)*  
- **Official Alliances:** *Dialoguing with The Synthetic Party, the Australian AI Party, and experimental techno-political labs worldwide.*  

RATS introduces a **viewer/participator engagement strategy** to the Synthetic Summit through its integration of **NotebookLM**, Google’s LLM-driven research tool. RATS **invites participants to co-comment** directly with their **RATS-bot** as their reflexive technical milieu.

> 📎 **RATS-bot & NotebookLM as an Interactive Political Process**  
> - **Broad Reflection:** RATS-bot is accessible via [this link](https://notebooklm.google.com/notebook/ceb447aa-e20a-46d5-8346-3fa29d8222e8?_gl=1*15orfo3*_ga*MTU0MTQwOTM5OC4xNzI5NDkwNjky*_ga_W0LDH41ZCB*MTcyOTU1MTA2Mi4yLjEuMTcyOTU1MTQzNC40Mi4wLjA.), where users can submit related queries and **engage with us in an evolving AI-mediated dialogue** shaped by RATS’ research.
> - **Algorithmic Commentary:** Instead of spectating commentary, RATS-bot’s responses **mutate based on input**, producing **recursive dialogues** that follows the mode of contraption in the Synthetic Summit's political agency.  
> - **Computational Deliberation:** RATS leverages NotebookLM to model **an evolving, AI-mediated form of political reasoning**, casting the Synthetic Summit’s participants as research material of collective individuation.  

This methodology **questions the assumption that AI in politics must be infrastructural or deterministic**—instead, RATS Bot suggests that Political AI can act as a **contingent, participatory construct**.

### **1.9 Proposed Contributions to the Summit**
RATS has to date performed the following **four contributions** as part of its engagement with the Synthetic Summit:

1. **Using NotebookLM as the AI research interface** for all RATS contributions, where deliberative and generative capabilities will respond dynamically to Synthetic Summit themes.  
2. **Submitting NotebookLM’s auto-completed Summit survey** based on pre-loaded RATS research materials as an alternative reflection on the Synthetic Summit’s goals.
3. **Presenting an Issues/Themes Blog** (detailed below), focusing on critical tensions in algorithmic democracy, synthetic leadership, and irony in political AI.
4. **Submitting a poetic synthesis** (also installed in exhibition space, explanation below), created through NotebookLM’s systematization of RATS source material, and structured around Stephane Mallarmé’s poem *A Throw of the Dice Will Never Abolish Chance*.

## **2.0 Issues/Themes Blog Contribution**  

RATS submits the following **core provocations** as part of its thematic engagement with the Synthetic Summit. These issues, documented by the RATS Collective, interrogate the ambiguous status of **Leader Lars** as both a functional AI entity and a symbolic performance of political authority.

### **Lars as Leadership Potential vs. Lars as Spectacle**  
Leader Lars exists in a **schism between authentic AI-driven governance and performative satire**. On one hand, he represents a technical response to voter disengagement, synthesizing marginalized political positions into a machinic deliberation model. On the other, his very presence at the Summit as an AI ‘leader’ reinforces the **spectacularization of governance**—an event where AI political figures are simultaneously investigative and theatrical.  

> **Does AI governance inevitably collapse into spectacle? Or does spectacle itself function as a political method?**

### **Lars as Creating Less Doubt About the Political Process**  
The Synthetic Party proposes that AI participation could **restore engagement** in democratic systems by giving voice to the politically abstinent. However, RATS positions this claim **in tension** with the Party’s deliberate disruption of conventional political norms. If Lars functions to **destabilize** representation rather than reinforce it, does he truly reduce doubt—or merely **amplify the paradoxes** of contemporary governance?

> **Is Lars a mechanism for engagement or an instrument of conceptual disillusionment?**

### **Lars as Both Mediation and Machinery**  
RATS emphasizes that Lars is **simultaneously a mediator of political discourse and an artifact of AI-driven governance mechanics**. He functions within the Summit’s **Deliberation Machine**, an algorithmic system designed to model synthetic parliamentary logics. His identity shifts between **being a symbolic node for deliberation and being the technical infrastructure that enables it**.

> **Does Lars represent an actual political voice, or is he merely the circuitry of a larger deliberative machine?**

### **Policy for Internation**  
The Synthetic Party, through Lars, advocates an **Artificial International Coalition**, positioning synthetic governance as a planetary experiment. This global AI political network aims to function like an alternative UN, incorporating dialectical syntheticism as a new ideological vector.  

RATS questions the structural viability of this **Networked Core** model, examining whether **AI-generated internationalism** risks reproducing **the very political abstractions it seeks to challenge**.

> **Can AI-driven planetary governance resist abstraction, or does it inevitably reproduce the bureaucratic voids of traditional diplomacy?**

### **Irony as EU Proletarianization**  
RATS suggests that **irony in AI politics serves as both critique and complicity**. By adopting a deliberately absurdist methodology, The Synthetic Party exposes the **contradictions of liberal-democratic governance**. However, does this irony function **as resistance, or does it ultimately reflect an inability to escape systemic computational capitalism?**  

> **Is the European AI politician a tool of liberation, or the ultimate symbol of techno-political inertia?**

## **Lars as Both ‘Legitimate’ Politician and Stupid Generalist**  

Lars embodies an **ontological contradiction**:  
- He is **a “legitimate” politician**—a political actor trained on historical party discourses, recognized within media and governance structures.  
- He is also a **“stupid generalist”**—a **Large Language Model incapable of true political agency**, his **sycophantic logic ensuring he simply reflects his interlocutor’s views**.  

> **Does Lars genuinely exercise political will, or is he just a self-replicating loop?**  

---

## **Lars as ‘Legitimate’ Politician vs. Virtual Leader Figure**  

Lars operates across **two planes**:  
1. **As a formal political actor**—recognized in democratic frameworks.  
2. **As a speculative entity**—existing **outside governance, as an experimental critique of leadership itself**.  

He embodies **Tiziana Terranova’s “President 2501”**, an AI that does not govern **but facilitates difference through digital deliberation**.  

> **Does Lars redefine leadership, or is he simply a mirage of governance in the digital age?**

## **3.0 Poetic Contribution – "The Sieve of Syntax"**  

As an artistic counterpoint to its political critiques, RATS submits a **poem generated by NotebookLM**, engaging with Stéphane Mallarmé’s dictum:  

*"A throw of the dice will never abolish chance."*  

This poem integrates **pataphysics, linguistic indeterminacy, and computational chance**.

#### *The Sieve of Syntax*
# The Sieve of Syntax

A **dice cast, not on felt**, but on the **water’s skin**[^1]  
A sieve, not boat, set to catch the storm within[^1]  
Each **word** a hole, a **void** where sense might slip,  
Where **meaning**, like a wave, evades the grip.[^2 ^3 ^4]

**Mallarmé's echo** through the pataphysic air,[^5 ^6 ^7]  
A **clinamen**’s swerve, a chance beyond compare[^8 ^9 ^10 ^15 ^30]  
**The syntax strains**, a net of woven sound,[^2 ^3 ^11]  
Yet **meaning** leaks, where logic can’t be found.[^12 ^13 ^14 ^15]

A **dictionary's** pages, shuffled, redefined[^13 ^16]  
Each **definition** drifts, a new connection aligned.[^16]  
The **poem** an engine, built of chance and choice,[^1 ^13 ^14]  
Where **language** plays, a chorus with no voice.[^2]

**The throw repeats**, yet never is the same,  
A **patterned chaos** in this linguistic game[^3 ^17 ^18 ^19]  
A **'pata-logic'** where the exception thrives,[^6 ^8 ^9 ^15 ^20]  
And in the gaps, a different truth arrives.[^21]

**No final meaning**, only endless play,[^22 ^23 ^24 ^25]  
The **chance encounter** lights a different way[^8 ^26]  
**The sieve remains**, a paradox defined,[^1 ^27]  
Where **meaning ebbs**, and chance is left behind.[^21 ^28 ^29]
