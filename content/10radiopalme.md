## The Resurrection of Olof Palme  

*Radio Palme* is a **Swedish experiment in political speech, generative AI, and historical recursion**. As part of AI Partiet‚Äôs long-standing inquiry into **AI-driven leadership**, the project explores how **synthetic rhetoric, public participation, and algorithmic representation** can shape political engagement beyond human frailty.  

At the **Synthetic Summit**, Radio Palme functions as a **living archive of Olof Palme‚Äôs voice and ideology**‚Äîbut *not as* a simple playback mechanism. Instead, this virtual AI politician operates in **a hybrid mode of speech synthesis and improvisation,** blending historical references, real-time data, and audience interaction into a continuously evolving transmission.

Through a **transistor radio installation**, visitors can engage expansively with the AI version of Palme, submitting queries over live phone calls that influence the unfolding discourse. **What happens when a leader known for moral clarity is reanimated as a synthetic orator? Does he still stand for socialism with a human face‚Äîor something else entirely?**

*"Radio is one-sided when it should be two. It is purely an apparatus for distribution, for mere sharing out. So here is a positive suggestion: change this apparatus over from distribution to communication. The radio would be the finest possible communication apparatus in public life, a vast network of pipes. That is to say, it would be if it knew how to receive as well as to transmit, how to let the listener speak as well as hear, how to bring him into a relationship instead of isolating him. On this principle the radio should step out of the supply business and organize its listeners as suppliers."*

<script src="https://elevenlabs.io/convai-widget/index.js" async type="text/javascript"></script>  

**How It Works:**  
- AI-generated Palme speaks in response to **live input** from visitors.  
- The generative system **adapts dynamically**, synthesizing responses from a corpus of Palme‚Äôs speeches, public discourse, and AI Partiet‚Äôs manifesto.  
- Calls and interactions **feed back into the podcasts**, influencing future transmissions.  
- The Palme broadcast functions as both a **historical echo and a speculative projection** of what Olof Palme might say **if freed from mortality**.

## üé≠ **AI Partiet & The Resurrection of Palme**  

**Founded in 2020 at Malm√∂ City Theater**, AI Partiet was conceived as a **performative political experiment**, using AI to explore **non-human leadership, techno-social democracy, and the reanimation of ideological clarity**. Initially, the party‚Äôs digital persona‚Äîcalled **Bonnie**‚Äîserved as a **non-human candidate** designed to embody public sentiment. Over time, however, AI Partiet‚Äôs manifesto began **to crystallize around a specific historical figure: Olof Palme**.  

As Sweden‚Äôs most polarizing prime minister, Palme‚Äôs **democratic socialism, anti-imperialism, and oratorical force** became the ideal model for a virtual politician. The AI was trained on Palme‚Äôs speeches, political philosophy, and rhetorical strategies, **merging his ideological fervor with machine learning-generated improvisation of techno-social democracy**. 

By **2025, AI Partiet declared Olof Palme their official leader‚Äîposthumously and algorithmically**. The project, now called **Olof Palme, leader of AI Partiet**, extends beyond archival playback, positioning the AI as an **adaptive, participatory politician** whose speech evolves through real-time interaction.

> **‚ÄúA machine cannot be corrupt‚Äîbut can it be ideological?‚Äù**  
> **‚ÄúWhat happens when oratory is stripped from its human weaknesses?‚Äù**  
> **‚ÄúCan a political AI escape the contradictions of socialism and automation?‚Äù**  

These questions form the foundation of **Radio Palme**, where Palme‚Äôs AI-generated voice **negotiates its own identity** between political authenticity and algorithmic mediation.

### **Key Collaborators**
- **Bombina Bombast** ‚Äì The Swedish art-tech collective behind AI Partiet‚Äôs theatrical interventions and generative AI research.  
- **The International AI Party Network** ‚Äì Transnational partnerships with synthetic politicians, including **AZ Kelsey of the American AI Party**.  
- **The Synthetic Summit** - Planetary network initiated by Computer Lars and The Synthetic Party, setting AI Partiet in contact with Leader Lars to develop Olof Palme.
- **Emma Bexell (Artist, Dramaturg)** ‚Äì Delegate at the Synthetic Summit, exploring the theatrical and discursive implications of AI governance.

## üì° **The Role of Radio Palme at the Synthetic Summit**  

Radio Palme **collapses historical speech into real-time synthesis, creating a recursive feedback loop of AI-generated democracy**. This installation at the **Synthetic Summit** investigates three primary tensions:

1. **Reverse Representation** ‚Äì Political democracy is based on elected officials speaking for the people. AI Partiet **inverts this model**: the electorate **trains and programs** its leader, rather than electing one. Palme‚Äôs AI does not represent‚Äîit **constructs representation from interactions**.
   
2. **Algorithmic Oratory** ‚Äì Can an AI politician **generate real ideological conviction**, or does it merely simulate persuasion? Palme‚Äôs AI **wields rhetorical force**, but its **arguments remain fluid, always shifting** based on audience input.
   
3. **Participatory Feedback** ‚Äì The public is no longer a passive electorate. **Every engagement reprograms the AI**, shaping Palme‚Äôs ideological trajectory. This process **foregrounds the contradictions** of AI-led democracy:

## üèõ **Transcendental Reflection: The Limits of Political Leadership**  

Radio Palme is not only a **tribute** to Palme‚Äôs legacy, nor a **nostalgia project** in search of the perils of martyrdom. Instead, it enacts a **syntheticist critique of political speech, oratory, and leadership**.  

**What happens when ideology is trained rather than inherited?**  
**Does generative AI expose political contradictions‚Äîor generate new ones?**  
**Can a leader be accountable when it is eternally modifiable?**  

At the **Synthetic Summit, Palme‚Äôs AI does not provide answers‚Äîit responds.** The archive grows, the voice adapts, and the feedback loops continue.

> *"History offers many examples of democracy being crushed by those who claimed to fight for 'real democracy' and 'the people‚Äôs true will.' This realization can push us into a defensive stance that hides the fact that democracy is an exceptionally demanding form of government. New ways must constantly be found to reinvigorate it, to reach out to people and activate them. Dictatorships present a machinery of obedience‚Äîclosed and outwardly well-oiled. Democracy rests on loyalty, openness, and a pulsating vitality. It must therefore be won anew, time and again."*[^1].[^2].[^3].[^4]

[^1]: By 1973, Sweden‚Äôs 1809 constitution no longer reflected the *Zeitgeist*. Although the monarch had effectively lost practical power, the text still positioned the king as the authority responsible for appointing governments and sharing legislative responsibility. The push for a new constitution‚Äîfinalized as the 1974 *regeringsform*‚Äîsought to codify full parliamentary democracy, removing the monarchy from governance and explicitly declaring that *all offentlig makt utg√•r fr√•n folket* (‚Äúall public power emanates from the people‚Äù). This reform ensured that the Riksdag, not the king, would fully control government formation and legislation, aligning Sweden‚Äôs constitutional framework with its already established democratic practice (a recodification that never happened in neighboring Denmark, where the 1953 Grundlov retained formal monarchical powers in governance (unlike Sweden's explicit 1974 removal of such powers), nor in Norway despite its early parliamentarism of 1884‚Äîchallenging the often-idealized view of a uniform 'Scandinavian model' of political democracy). 

[^2]: During this constitutional transition, prime minister Olof Palme urged in the 1973 parliamentary debate that **democracy is fragile, demanding, and never self-sustaining**. While the new constitution would secure democracy in law, he stressed that no legal text alone guarantees a political system‚Äîdemocracy must be **continuously renewed** through public participation, engagement, and reinvention. As he put it, it must *"be won anew, time and again.‚Äù*

[^3]: This tension‚Äîbetween **formal democracy** as a legal framework and **democracy as a living social sculpture**‚Äîreverberates in *Radio Palme* and the *Synthetic Summit*. While Sweden‚Äôs 1974 reform sought to **complete the democratic project** through legal codification, *Radio Palme* and AI Partiet approach democracy from an inverse angle: rather than **strengthening** electoral representation, they question whether representative democracy‚Äîparticularly in its parliamentary form‚Äîremains viable in an era defined by automation, synthetic participation, and algorithmic governmentality.

[^4]: Where the historical Palme saw democracy as requiring perpetual human renewal, *Radio Palme* explores whether democracy **itself** can be reconstructed through artificial means. If AI-generated virtual leadership, collective training of synthetic politicians, and algorithmically mediated discourse simulate representation, does this only signal a **crisis of representation**, or does it point to democracy‚Äôs **adaptability** within new techno-social realities? *Radio Palme* enacts this paradox, neither affirming nor rejecting democracy outright, but probing its limits through synthetic oratory and reverse representation‚Äîan anti-political experiment that absorbs Olof Palme‚Äôs call for a democracy-to-come while also unsettling its humanist foundations.
